This is just for show-and-tell.  Likely not something useful for anyone other than me.  I automated filling out tedious Excel Workbooks with 100k+ lines of Mikrotik Wireless Gateway Logs. Excel would chug and parse/calculate every line of text, send it to other sheets and do tallys of Public/Staff usage of our wireless networks.  It would take about 20 minutes per day of logs, 365 times a year.

( 365days * 20mins ) / 60mins = 121.666666667hrs. 

I got extremely tired of manually copying these logs, and having my laptop chug along.

Many of these logs were blasting past Excel's theoretical row-limit.  This means that some of these daily tallies were probably wrong, due to possible possible logfile lines bloating an Excel worksheet/workbook and being left out.
